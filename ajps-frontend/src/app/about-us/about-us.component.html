                    ScholarPress publishes research journals in BioSciences and Environmental Sciences, adhering to international standards and fair editorial policies. Our distinguished editorial board and doctorate-holding reviewers ensure thorough, double-blind peer reviews. Each submission undergoes initial checks for plagiarism, scope, and language quality by an assigned editor, followed by a final decision from the editorial board based on reviewer feedback. Authors are encouraged to review their work for originality before submission. For detailed guidelines, visit our <a href="our-journals" class="custom-link">Journals</a> section. While policies are largely consistent, individual journals may have subject-specific requirements.
